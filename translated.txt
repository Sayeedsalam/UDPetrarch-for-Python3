The document says that in the "action" the Colombian military rescued the body of Luis Edgar Devia, the real name of alias "Ra \ u00fal Reyes" from the command of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC ), like personal items, three computers, documents and correspondence of the "terrorist". He added that by intelligence information, an operation was prepared to take a place in Colombian territory "where Reyes and other FARC guerrillas were. It is specified that "at a time when the helicopter units of the Colombian (Colombian) Force were approaching, they received intense fire from guerrillas located in our territory and fighting took place. It was at that time that the units were attacked, since a place less than 1,800 meters from the border, in Ecuadorian territory. " Clarify that before the attack, the Colombian military "reacted and used force to the place where they were being attacked" and that that action left 12 dead guerrillas as a result, including "Ra \ u00fal" Kings\". The Colombian government said that given the situation "it was essential that Colombian troops enter Ecuadorian territory to search the site from where they were shot and attacked." He adds that the military transferred the bodies of Reyes and other rebels to Colombian territory to "prevent the guerrillas from supplanting them, in compliance with a practice they usually carry out, to accuse our forces of extrajudicial executions." The statement ensures that Reyes directs \ "criminal \" operations in southern Colombia and "clandestinely, from Ecuadorian territory without the consent of that Government." For the rest, the Colombian government has pledged to compensate Ecuadorian citizens who may have been affected by the attacks. Minutes after knowing the position of the Colombian government, the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, announced the \ "immediate expulsion \" of Colombia&#39;s ambassador to Quito, Carlos Holgu \ u00edn, after the withdrawal of his ambassador In Bogotá, Francisco Su \ u00e9scum, and requested the urgent meeting of the OAS and the CAN to analyze the Colombian attack on Ecuadorian territory. Correa also ordered the "mobilization of troops" on the border with Colombia demanding the government of Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, not only apologies, but "signed commitments to respect Ecuador" "," date_added ": null," _id ":" 5c72fa84230d8759e607cd14 "," pub_date ":" 2008-03-02 00:00:00 "}}

It is inspired by the character \ Features that have butterfly wings and nasturtium leaves (a climbing plant with buckled leaves native to Peru). \ n \ nThe material \ "can be hydrophobic \" can keep clothes dry and prevent the formation of ice in the engines of airplanes, experts say worked on the subject. \ n \ nThe lotus leaf was thought to be the element of nature that managed to repel water more effectively, but a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the United States, says there is something better. \ n \ nTo add a species of The mini-scale grooves to a surface made of silicon managed to increase the speed with which the water bounces, which represents an increase of 40% in relation to the reference values used so far. \ n \ nThis type grooves are found in the wings of the Morpho butterflies and in the veins of the nasturtium leaves. \ n \ nScientists expect the use of this material on metal surfaces, in fabrics and ceramic ceramics9 Start to a new generation of moisture-resistant products, from tents to wind turbines that generate electric power. \ n \ nThe perfect pancake \ n \ n \ "We believe this compound is the m \ u00e1s hydrophobic that exists at the moment \ ", says Kripa Varanasi, one of the professors who participated in its development. \ n \ n \" For a long time the lotus has been used as a reference for manufacturing of waterproof products \ u2013pursuing- but you should start thinking about copy the characteristics of the butterflies and nasturtiums \ ". \ n \ nWhile faster a drop of water bounces off a waterproof coat, the drier will stay dry. In the case of electricity cables, the process of corrosion or freezing before the water fall will be delayed if the drop bounces faster. \ N \ n Following this logic, the scientists recorded droplets falling on different surfaces to calculate how long they remain on it. \ n \ nWhen falling on the lotus leaves, the water formed a perfect pancake. Then, a symmetric drop bounced. \ N \ n \ "The lotus effect" has been replicated in the manufacture of fabrics, paints and tiles. The secret lies in its high "contact angle", which refers to a small part of the droplet that makes contact with the surface. \ N \ nA step beyond \ u00e1s \ u00e1 \ Taking into account what happens with the lotus flowers, Varanasi and his team decided to concentrate on a different paradigm: contact time. \ n \ nSo they designed larger structures (macroscopic) which increase the area in which the liquid comes into contact with the surface, but which causes the drops to bounce faster, by separating them into asymmetric parts. \ n \ nWhen the slots were used in aluminum and copper , the water was repelled 40% faster than the lotus leaf would have done, just as the butterfly wings and nasturtiums did. \ n \ nIn extremely low temperatures, the water bounced \ u00f3 of these surfaces before it was frozen, a very useful property for aircraft engines. Varanasi believes that the use of the discovery of his equipment could increase the efficiency in the operation of the blades in turbines that are used in power plants and to generate power. \ n \ n \ "The challenge is durability. The &#39;hydrophobic&#39; materials are very cold biopolymers, they do not withstand abrasion or high temperatures. But the elements we analyze, together with other stronger ones, such as metal and ceramics, may be the solution, "says Varanasi. \ N \ nPractical effects \ n \ nA \ u00f1dd the characteristics Waterproof materials described in the research of MIT specialists to certain materials is not difficult, as stated in the study published in the journal Nature. \ n \ n Current mowers can make the grooves, which allow The process can be carried out on an industrial scale.This design could also be replicated in fabrics, Varanasi considers. \ n \ n \ "Sportswear, coats, military clothing and tents. There are a lot of areas where you want to avoid water and moisture. Now we need the designers: How do we manage to create a web that includes the elements that we analyze? \ ". \ N \ nThe team that works in the laboratory you run is planning to perfect its discovery and optimize it with the goal of creating mixtures that are even more waterproof. \ n \ n \ "I hope we can reduce contact time by 70% or 80%. There are possibilities because in our experiments we use a single slot, but in the wings of the butterflies there are intersecting grooves, which allows the drops to be divided into four parts. And if this number is longer, the contact time decreases, "explains the scientist. \ N \ nAnd whoever has doubts about his claim, could investigate his history of discoveries. \ N \ nIn Its laboratory was designed the LiquiGlide, a coating that manages to remove up to the last drop of a bottle of tomato sauce, which was recognized with the MIT Business Competition Audience Award in 2012. \ n \ n \ "We are in the search of our next venture. We open a small window for people to wonder what a &#39;hydrophobic&#39; material is.

Can an individual be blamed for this result? It is the responsibility of both the party and the government. Everyone, including myself, is responsible for the defeat of the party, "said PTI Ahmed Patel, political advisor to Sonia Gandhi. \ N \ nIn the same vein, the most veteran member of Congress in the Parliament, Kamal Nath, assured NDTV yesterday that only \ "internal democracy \" could end \ "the culture of clientelism \" within the party and that \ "Rahul cannot be blamed for the defeat \ ". \ n \ nHowever, Rahul, dolphin of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, who has failed to excite voters with his little charisma, an image of an inexperienced and a confusing message, was recognized last Friday, after knowing the results, \ "responsible \" for the defeat. \ n \ nThe great-grandson, grandson and son of prime ministers, has not been helped by the wear and tear of his party after 10 years in power, harassed by corruption cases and the slowdown in growth. \ n \ nThe electoral debacle of Congress is greater if the 44 seats are compared obtained in these elections with the worst result of the formation to date, in 1999, when the party reached 114 seats, more than double that of the current ones.
